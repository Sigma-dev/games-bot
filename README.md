# games-bot
A discord bot designed to play multiplayer games.

# How to use

Pull the repo in an empty folder
Do:
```
npm install 
```
then create a .env file with a DISCORD_TOKEN property with a valid discord bot token.

Once that is done you should be able to do:
```
npm run start
```

If this works then you just have to set it up in the discord app

In discord:
-invite your bot to your server
-create channels named after the games you want to play (ex: "monopoly" to play monopoly)
-use the "Help" command to get a quick guide on how to start playing.

This is it, you can now play with your friends!
